# Selecting and Moving Passages

## Selecting Passages

Click or tap a single passage cardto select it. You can select multiple passage
cards by holding the Shift or Control key while selecting a particular passage.
To deselect while keeping the rest of your selection intact, Shift- or
Control-click it.

If you are using a mouse, you can drag with the left mouse button beginning in
an empty part of the map to create a rectangular selection. Hold down the Shift
or Control key while doing so to add passages to an existing selection.

To select all passages, choose _Select All_ from the _Passage_ top toolbar tab.

To deselect all passages, click in an empty part of the map.

## Moving Passages

To move passage cards you've selected, drag them to a new place using the left
mouse button or finger.

By default, Twine will snap passage cards to the gridlines of the story map. If
you'd like to disable this behavior, choose _Details_ from the _Story_ top
toolbar tab and uncheck the _Snap to Grid_ checkbox. This setting is specific to
each story in your library, so one story can use grid snapping while another
doesn't.

Grid snapping only affects passage cards when you move them. It doesn't affect
the existing position of cards.
