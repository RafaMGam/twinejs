# Deleting Passages

To delete passages, select them in the map and choose _Delete_ from the
_Passage_ top toolbar tab. You can also press the Backspace or Delete key as a
shortcut.

Deleting passages can be undone using [the buttons in the corner of the top
toolbar](undoing.md). (So can almost all actions in the Story Map screen, but
because deleting stories is permanent, it's worth calling out here.)
