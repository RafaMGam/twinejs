# Viewing Story Statistics

To see statistics Twine collects about your story, choose _Details_ from the
_Story_ top toolbar tab. This shows:

- The number of characters and words in all of your passage text.
- The number of passages in your story.
- The number of links and broken links in your story.
- When you story was last changed.
- The IFID of your story.

IFIDs are akin to ISBNs for books. They help catalog Twine stories alongside
other forms of interactive fiction. You can learn more about IFIDs at [the
Interactive Fiction Database](https://ifdb.org/help-ifid).
