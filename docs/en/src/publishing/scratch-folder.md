# The Scratch Folder

This page only applies to app Twine.

When you choose to test, play, or proof a Twine story, app Twine creates a file
and opens it in your web browser. This file is created in your _scratch folder_.
By default, this is a folder named `Scratch` inside your Twine folder.

When you quit app Twine, it cleans up your scratch folder, deleting files that
are more than three days old. (This delay is so that you can continue to view
your work after quitting Twine, and in an emergency, [potentially recover your
work](../troubleshooting/backups.md).) However, you can delete files in the
scratch folder on your own. Files in the scratch folder are only meant to be
used for viewing your work in a browser. Twine will never put anything in the
scratch folder that isn't meant to be short-lived.

Twine's Scratch folder behavior can customized using [command-line
switches](../customizing/command-line.md).
