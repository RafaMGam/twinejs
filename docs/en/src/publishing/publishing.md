# Publishing a Story

Publishing a story creates an HTML file that can opened in a web browser.

You can publish a story from both the _Story Library_ and _Story Map_ screens.

- In the Story Library screen, select the story, then choose _Publish to File_
  from the _Build_ top toolbar tab.
- In the Story Map screen, choose _Publish to File_ from the _Build_ top toolbar
  tab.

Twine will then ask you to choose a file name and location to save your
published file.

Some versions of the Safari web browser may instead open a browser tab with an
address that begins with `blob://`. If this happens, choose _Save As_ from
Safari's _File_ menu to save your story to a file.

## Now That I Have a Published File, What Do I Do?

The short answer is that you can publish your story anywhere an HTML file can be
published. You could send this directly to people using email or publish it to a
web site. Some cloud file hosting services might allow you to publish your file
in a web-accessible form, but many limit this functionality so that a story can
only be downloaded by viewers, not directly played in a brwoser.

Two services that offer Twine-specific hosting are
[Borogove](https://borogove.app) and [Itch.io](https://itch.io). Itch is more of
a marketplace, while Borogove is more closely aligned with the interactive
fiction community.
