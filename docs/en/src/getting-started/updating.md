# Updating Twine

## Browser Twine

Browser Twine is updated when there's a new release, so there's no work for
you to do to stay up-to-date. If you need to use an older version, go to
`https://twinery.org/[version number]`. That is, to use 2.3.13, go to
`https://twinery.org/2.3.13`. These different versions will use the same story
library and preferences.

Keep in mind, though, that earlier versions will have bugs the most recent
version does not, and there might be strange behavior moving backwards in time,
so you should only use an older version if you really need to.

## App Twine

To check if a newer version of Twine is available, choose _Check for Updates_
from the menu named _Twine_ in the menu bar (not the top toolbar). Twine will
tell you if there's an update available and, if you like, will direct you to
where to go to download the new version. Twine doesn't automatically update
itself.
