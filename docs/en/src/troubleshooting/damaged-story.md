# If Your Story Is Damaged

In some cases, a story might be visible in Twine but editing it shows things in
a bad state: passages might be missing, put in odd locations, or have garbled
text.

In some cases, solving this problem is as easy as quitting and re-opening app
Twine or reloading browser Twine. When Twine first starts up, it checks your
stories for possible problems and repairs them where it can.

But if restarting Twine doesn't help, you'll probably need to [restore a backup
version of your story](backups.md).
