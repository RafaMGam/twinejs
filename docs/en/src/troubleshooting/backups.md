# Backups

The best way to prevent losing work in Twine is to back up your work regularly.

## In App Twine

App Twine makes a backup copy of your work every time you start the application,
and every 20 minutes while you are working. By default, it creates a folder
called Backups next to the story library folder. That is, if your story library
folder is in Home › Documents › Twine › Stories, your backups are in Home ›
Documents › Twine › Backups.

The location of your backup folder can be set [using a command-line switch](../customizing/command-line.md).

You can also keep backups of your own by copying your story library folder, or
individual stories, to another location.

## In Browser Twine

You must keep backups yourself using the
[Archive](../story-library/exporting.md) feature.

## What If I Forgot to Keep Backups And Thing Went Wrong?

You may not be completely out of luck.

In addition to automatic backups, app Twine creates files in the [scratch
folder](../publishing/scratch.md). Files in this folder are created when you
play, test, or proof a story. You may be able to recover your work from files
here.
