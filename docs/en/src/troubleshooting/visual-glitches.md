# If You See Visual Glitches in Twine

This page only applies to app Twine.

If you see visual glitches often in Twine, turning off hardware accleration may
help. You should only do this if you are seeing a problem. As the name implies,
using hardware acceleration speeds up Twine's display.

To do this, go to _Troubleshooting_ under the _Help_ menu, then choose _Disable
Hardware Acceleration_. This item will be checked when hardware acceleration is
disabled, but changing the setting will only take effect the next time you
launch Twine.

You can also disable hardware acceleration with a [command-line
switch](../customizing/command-line.md).
