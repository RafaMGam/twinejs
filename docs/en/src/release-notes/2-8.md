# Twine 2.8.0

## New Features Added

- In App Twine only:
  - The location of the story library can be changed. It can be done either
    using a menu item preference or command-line switch.
  - Hardware accelerated graphics can be disabled. It can be done either using a
    menu item preference or command-line switch.
  - The location of story library backups can be changed. This can only be done
    using a command-line switch. Please read the documentation carefully before
    using this option.
  - Instead of using the system-wide temporary directory, Twine now uses a
    dedicated scratch folder and prunes old files from it automatically. The
    location of this folder can be changed using a command-line switch only.
    Please read the documentation carefully before using this option.
- A Korean localization has been added.

## Bugs Fixed

  the passage to move incorrectly has been fixed.
- An issue where closing a passage editor while the find dialog was open caused
  a crash has been fixed.

## Behind the Scenes

- The app now uses Vite for bundling instead of create-react-app.
- The underlying Electron framework for the desktop app has been updated to
  version 26.
