## New Features Added

- Passage edit dialogs now show leading and trailing whitespace in passage names

  More info on how this works is in [the
  reference](https://twinery.org/reference/en/customizing/advanced.html).

  that the amount of space in the story map is increased.

  when open in conjunction with passage editors.
