# Twine 2.3.2

  has been fixed.

  "1.0.0-beta1") are now correctly handled.

  previous repository.

  release.

---

# Twine 2.3.1

Release Date: April 21, 2019

## Bugs fixed

- In the desktop app, file saving is done in a safer manner so that if a problem
  occurs, any file that would have been overwritten should stay intact.
- The desktop app now keeps short-term backups of your story library in case a
  bug occurs that affects the data on disk. It saves a backup copy of your
  library to a Backups folder in the main Twine folder when you first start it
  up, and every 20 minutes while Twine is running. It only keeps 10 backups at
  most, deleting older ones as needed, so this is not a full-fledged backup
  solution (and is not intended to be). It is intended as a way to restore data
  in the event of a crash or bug that overwrites data saved on disk.
- The Chinese localization that should have appeared in 2.3.0 is in this
  version.

## Features added

- Harlowe has been updated to version 3.0.2.

---

# Twine 2.3.0

Release Date: April 14, 2019

## Features added

- The desktop app now uses Electron instead of NW.js. This should resolve many
  crash issues, and also bring improved performance, as saving changes is now
  done on a separate processing thread than the main user interface.
- The files in the story directory are now published as full-fledged stories,
  where possible.
- Bahasa Malaysia and Russian have been added as locale choices.
- Harlowe has been updated to 3.0.1.
- SugarCube has been updated to 2.28.2.

## Bugs fixed

- Issues with passages being placed in strange places after being dragged while
  Snap to Grid is turned on have been fixed.
- If you have a test or play version of a story already open when you choose to
  test or play it again, the window or tab should update with the current
  version.
- The welcome screen now scrolls properly when the **Next** button is used.
