# Changing the Library's Location

This page only applies to app Twine. In browser Twine, your story library is
stored invisibly in your browser's storage.

You can change the folder of your story library by choosing _Set Story Library
Folder..._ from the _Twine_ menu. The folder you choose here will take effect
the next time you launch Twine.

If Twine isn't able to read files in the story library folder you've set when
it's starting up, it will show a dialog box where you can choose to either use
the default folder location or quit the application.

You can also change the story library location using a [command-line
switch](../customizing/command-line.md).
