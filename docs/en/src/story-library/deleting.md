# Deleting Stories

To delete a story, select it and choose _Delete_ from the _Story_ top toolbar
tab.

**In browser Twine, deletion is permanent.** You may want to [archive your
story](exporting.md) before deleting it.

In app Twine, deleted story files are moved to your trash can or recycling bin
on macOS and Windows. (On Linux, Twine does its best to move the story to the
trash, but what exactly it does depends on your desktop environment). If you
change your mind about deleting a story, you can take it out of the trash or
recycling bin and [re-import the story file](creating.md).
