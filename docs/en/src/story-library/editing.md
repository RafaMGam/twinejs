# Editing Stories

To start editing a story, you can either double-click/tap a story, or select
_Edit_ from the _Story_ tab in the top toolbar.

You can only edit one story at a time in the downloadable version of Twine. On a
browser, you can open Twine in multiple tabs and edit a different story in each
one, but editing the same story in multiple tabs will almost certainly cause
problems. Browsers isolate tabs from each other for security, which means that
Twine in one tab can easily overwrite changes made in a second tab on the same
story.
