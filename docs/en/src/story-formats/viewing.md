# Viewing Story Formats

To view a list of story formats installed in your version of Twine, choose
_Story Formats_ from the _Twine_ top toolbar tab. By default, the Story Formats
screen will show you the newest version of every story format you have
installed. Each card in the Story Formats screen represents a single format
that's installed. This list shows both regular story formats and proofing ones
together, and is sorted alphabetically by name.

Story formats that come installed with Twine have a sticker on them labeled
"Built In." The [default story format](default.md) has a sticker on it labeled
"Used as Default," and the format that's used for proofing stories has a "Used
for Proofing" sticker.

If Twine isn't able to load a story format, it will show an error symbol on its
card with a short explanation of the error it encountered.

To view only story formats you've added yourself, choose _User-Added Story
Formats_ from the _View_ top toolbar tab.

To view all formats, including older versions of story formats, choose _All
Story Formats_ from the _View_ top toolbar tab.
